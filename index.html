        <p>
            Greetings! My name is Daniel Hoyos, a curious and fun guy born and raised in the exotic and diverse lands of Colombia. Dog-lover, football-player, book-reader. I enjoy experiencing new adventures and learning about a wide range of fields.

            As a professional, I have dedicated most of the my as a back-end developer implementing business logic and integrating it with databases, but my curiosity and my adventurous spirit have led me into learning new technologies and languages specially in the front-end field.

            <p>
                Most of the projects I have been involved with, use Agile/Scrum methodology. I also have worked extensively with tools inside the Atlassian family (Jira, Confluence, Bitbucket). GIT is my favorite source control system, but SVN and CVS have been part of some projects as well.
